The dashboard has 3 components:
* 2 dropdowns to select the ship type and name. 
* below the 2 dropdowns there is a one-line table which presents the longest distanced travelled between 2 consecutive observations for the specific ship. 
* a map which present the beggining and end points of ship's movement. 
  * above the map there is a note which informes about the direct distance between the points on the map + the total distance travelled (both in meters)
